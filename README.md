# Problem Solving Practice

A comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm challenges, showcasing systematic problem-solving approaches and clean code implementation in Java. This repository demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and technical growth while building strong analytical and coding skills.

## Structure
Each solution is implemented as a separate class with:
- Problem link in comments
- Solution implementation
- Test cases where applicable

## Solutions List
| Problem Name | Difficulty | Category | Link |
|--------------|------------|----------|------|
| ValidParentheses | Easy | Stack | [Solution](https://github.com/islamostafa/ProblemSolving/blob/main/ValidParenthese.java) |
| ContainsDuplicate | Easy | Array/Hash Table | [Solution](https://github.com/islamostafa/ProblemSolving/blob/main/ContainsDuplicate.java) |
| SingleNumber | Easy | Array/XOR | [Solution](https://github.com/islamostafa/ProblemSolving/blob/main/SingleNumber.java) |
| isPalindrome | Easy | Two Pointers | [Solution](https://github.com/islamostafa/ProblemSolving/blob/main/isPalindrome.java) |
